Example Uber app for developers
==============================

https://developer.uber.com/

What Is This?
-------------

This is a simple Python/Flask application intended to provide a working example of Uber's external API. The goal of these endpoints is to be simple, well-documented and to provide a base for developers to develop other applications off of.


How To Use This
---------------

1. Navigate over to https://developer.uber.com/, and sign up for an Uber developer account.
2. Register a new Uber application and make your Redirect URI http://localhost:7000/submit
3. Record the Client ID and Client Secret

Running Locally
---------------

1. Fill in the relevant information in the `config.json` file in the root folder and add your client id and secret as the environment variables UBER_CLIENT_ID AND UBER_CLIENT_SECRET. Run ‘export UBER_CLIENT_ID=”YOUR_CLIENT_ID”&&export UBER_CLIENT_SECRET=”YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET”’
4. Run ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’ to install dependencies
5. Run ‘python app.py’

Running on Heroku
-----------------

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

When prompted, add your client ID and client secret.

Testing
-------

1. Install the dependencies with ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’
2. Run the command ‘nosetests -v’
3. If you delete the fixtures, or decide to add some of your own, you’ll have to re-generate them, and the way this is done is by running the app, getting an auth_token from the main page of the app. Paste that token in place of the ‘test_auth_token’ at the top of the test_endpoints.py file, then run the tests.


Development
-----------

If you want to work on this application we’d love your pull requests and tickets on GitHub!

2. If you send us a pull request, make sure you add a test for what you added, and make sure the full test suite runs with nosetests -v.
